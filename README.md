# Flash Cards

This project is built using HTML, CSS and JS. We create and display the flash cards. There is validation when creating a flash card. When flash card is successfully created, it will be saved inside the local storage which will ensure that your cards are still there until you delete them yourself. It will then display the flash card onto the page with 3 buttons/options to choose from (Show/Hide Answer, Edit, Delete). 

Requirements/validation for flash card:
* Question and Answer must be present
* Question and Answer must be between 3 to 60 characters long
